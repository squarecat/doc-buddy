# Documentation Buddy

Documentation Buddy is a Telegram chatbot powered by GPT and OpenAI. You can upload PDF and other documents, the bot will learn from them and you can ask it questions.

Useful in a variety of situations where you have too much information to learn and need a quick reference guide!

### Requirements

- Your own OpenAI account and API Key
- A Pinecone account and API Key (for embeddings)
- Somewhere s3-like to save files (for re-indexing if needed)
- A Telegram key from BotFather

### Optional Requirements:

- If you don't use the DigitalOcean one-click deploy then you will also need to run OpenAIs embeddings project separately. You can get it from [here](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin). If you do this then set the env variable `EMBEDDINGS_URL` to match. If you use the Deploy to DigitalOcean button below then this will be deployed for you as the `memory` component.
- A DigitalOcean account if you want to deploy directly to DigitalOceans App Platform. If you don't already have one, you can sign up [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=1f67a87765d4).

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Telegram bot with BotFather. Step-by-step guide [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot).
2. You will get a token from BotFather that looks like this: `4839574812:AAFD39kkdpWt3ywyRZergyOLMaJhac60qc`. You will use this for the `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` env variable later.
3. Create a [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) account. This is used to store the embeddings data of the uploaded documents.
4. Get a Pinecone API key from the settings pages. You will use this for the `PINECONE_API_KEY` env variable. The index will be created automatically later so you don't need to do anything else.
5. Create a Digital Ocean Space (or other s3 like storage). This is used to store the documents uploaded in case they need to be reindexed later.
6. Click the button below to deploy directly as a Digital Ocean App. This is a simple step-by-step process that takes <5 minutes.
7. On the Environment Variables page of the Digital Ocean App creation process, replace the default values with the values you've generated.
8. The app should start automatically and connect to the Telegram API
9. Open a chat in Telegram with the bot you created, and try chatting to it!

## Deploying the App

### Digital Ocean
Click this button to deploy the app to the DigitalOcean App Platform. If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to log in with your DigitalOcean account.

[![Deploy to DigitalOcean](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/squarecat/doc-buddy/tree/main&refcode=1f67a87765d4)

When you get to the "Review" section of the deploy, make sure to set the plan to `Basic` as it will default to `Pro`. The chat component should run fine on a $5/mo sized instance, and the memory component will probably be fine at $5 also, but much faster at $10/mo.

### Docker
1. `docker build -t doc-buddy`
2. Fill in container.env file with your keys from the Getting Started section
3. `docker run -p 3000:80 -d doc-buddy --env-file container.env`

You'll need to add these to the DigitalOcean app env variables.
